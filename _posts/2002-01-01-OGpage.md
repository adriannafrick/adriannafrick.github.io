description: From 1999-2003 I created a tutorial website to introduce those new to UNIX and Linux, Cisco networking, and system administration to commands and concepts like the OSI Model. All work was hand-coded in HTML using vi on a FreeBSD system. Although the server is long gone, this website is still available via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050308085824/http://www.dvcmedia.org/~adri/work.html"> The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine </a>.
