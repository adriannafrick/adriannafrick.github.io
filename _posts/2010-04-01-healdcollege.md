description: From 2008-2010 I taught a variety of courses as both adjunct and full-time faculty for Heald College prior to their acquisition by Corinthian College, including English, Public Speaking, and Cisco Routing. In addition to campus service including serving on the WASC accreditation committee, textbook selection committee, and teaching a campus-wide in-service on MLA citation, my work included creating syllabi, lesson plans, and exams. Examples include <a href="/assets/Engl10CourseOverview.pdf"> an English 10 Course Overview document</a>, <a href="/assets/Engl10CumulativeFinal.pdf"> a comprehensive English 10 cumulative final which doubled as a guide for post-class assistance</a>, and <a href="/assets/HealdInfoTech270.pdf"> an InfoTech270 Course overview</a> including a lesson plan for an innovative way of teaching network fundamentals as an icebreaker activity using envelopes and notecards.
