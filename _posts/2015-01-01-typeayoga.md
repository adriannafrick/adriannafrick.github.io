description: After completing the facilities move, Type A Yoga relaunched their website to take advantage of newer technologies. This included moving web hosting from Host Gator to Bluehost, and creating a WordPress site that allowed more customers to access the schedule, products, and their membership from their smartphones. This also required integrations with Mindbody, a common CRM for yoga studios, and social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and even LinkedIn for employment.
