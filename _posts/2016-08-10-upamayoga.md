description: Accredited 200-hour yoga teacher training including anatomy, physiology, Sanksrit, philosophy, cultural history, and various schools of practice. Project included a re-design in response to assessment and marketing research, which resulted in a more streamlined, modular offering. This increased the potential customer-base to include existing teachers who may have needed additional edcation in one or more topics.
