description: This 200-hour yoga teacher training including anatomy, physiology, Sanksrit, philosophy, cultural history, and various schools of practice was designed using ADDIE principles and required formal submission to the Yoga Alliance to receive industry accreditation. The multi-year project included a re-design in response to assessment and marketing research, which resulted in a more streamlined, modular offering. This increased the potential customer-base to include existing teachers who may have needed additional education in one or more topics. Examples of the <a href="/assets/UpamaYogaModularSyllabus.pdf"> module content</a> and <a href="/assets/UpamaYogaCatalog.pdf"> detailed course catalog</a> are linked here. These were offered in pdf form because the target clientele demographic was more comfortable with traditional academic course listings and printed catalogs.
