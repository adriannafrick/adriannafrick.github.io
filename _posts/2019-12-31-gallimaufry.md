description: A small indie publisher-founded writer's collective needed complete online presence. This included the design of a responsive website that would allow each writer to self-publish works, user permissions for editorial staff, various specialty plugins particular to writing, categorization for various genres, and a brand identity. I also created and managed their social media presence.
