description: After the web designer they paid delivered a product they didn't like, I assisted the Bay Area Preschools directory with fixing their directory data, backing up their website, and changing web hosts. I also worked with their directory plugin provider on fixing several bugs, and conducted several in-person trainings of administrative staff in Wordpress and the directory database structure to assist them with onboarding new schools. Their <a href="https://www.bayareapreschools.com/directory/">current site and directory is available here.</a>
