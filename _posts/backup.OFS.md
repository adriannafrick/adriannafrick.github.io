description: In 2018 I assisted Old Firehouse Schools with developing a podcast for their preschool families. In addition to initially editing, mixing, and assisting them with meeting iTunes requirements for listing their <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dorothy-stewart-606943480/darcy-campbell-creativity">Soundcloud-hosted podcast</a>, I created a <a href="/PodcastTutorial/">work aid/tutorial</a> to assist non-technical preschool teachers with editing and mixing their own podcasts in Audacity.
